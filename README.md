## 0X1B. C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

Implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. The goal of this ALX project is to understand the workings of different sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities.

## About

The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Counting Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bitonic Sort

Each algorithm is implemented as a function in C, and the repository includes a main file for each algorithm to test its functionality.

## Getting Started

To use these sorting algorithms, you need to have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your machine.

## Usage

To compile and run any of the algorithms, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 <main-file.c> <sort-function-file.c> print_array.c -o <outputfile>
./<outputfile>
